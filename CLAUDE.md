# Hierarchical Divine Liturgy — Deacon Training Video

Claude Code reads this file automatically at the start of every session.

Last updated: 19 August 2026. Encode complete. Now in git, with the raw
footage archived off-machine; directories reorganized; annotation work in
progress; the edit sheet is YAML and CSV support is gone.

---

## 1. The project

One training video for **deacons**, built from 37 short clips filmed at a
hierarchical Divine Liturgy, **20 June 2026**, OCA, Diocese of New York and
New Jersey (Archbishop MICHAEL; Metropolitan TIKHON). Each clip covers one
step of the service.

The video needs **explanatory text overlaid throughout** and **chapter
markers**. Annotations are rubric-level and choreographic: where to stand,
what to hold, which hand, what to say, and what cues trigger movement.

## 3. One script does everything

`build.py`. It replaced the earlier `rebuild.sh`, `make_card.sh`,
`card_from_image.sh`, and `make_subs.py` — all obsolete, do not reintroduce.

```bash
python3 build.py                 # full build
python3 build.py --help          # flags AND the full sheet-format reference
python3 build.py --clip 3        # preview one clip (also 3-5 or 3,7,19)
python3 build.py --clip 3 --cards none   # preview times = the clip's own times
python3 build.py --clip 3 --draft        # ~4x faster re-encode, blocky
python3 build.py --clip 3 --play         # open in VLC if the build succeeds
python3 build.py --clip 3 --timecode     # burn ORIGINAL clip time on screen
python3 build.py --fade 1.5              # audio fade at each clip end (default 3, 0 = off)
python3 build.py --cut-fade 0            # audio fade into each cut (default 1.5, 0 = off)
python3 build.py --subs-only     # regenerate annotations only, fast
python3 build.py --sheet other.yaml
python3 build.py --speed 6       # default rate for spans saying speed: true
python3 build.py --no-mkv
python3 build.py --youtube       # burn subs into youtube.mp4, slow
```

**Outputs, all into `output/`:** `master.mp4`, `liturgy_training.mkv`
(chapters + annotations embedded, subtitle track flagged default),
`annotations.ass`, `chapters.txt`, `youtube_chapters.txt`, `boundaries.tsv`.
Preview mode writes `output/preview.*` instead and leaves the real outputs
alone.

**A preview plays EDITED time; the sheet wants ORIGINAL time.** Once a clip
carries a cut, scrubbing the preview and reading the player's clock gives a
number that is wrong by however much the edits removed — and the user lost
work to exactly this on clip 4. `--timecode` burns the original clip time into
the corner of the preview, so the number on screen is the number to type.
Reach for it whenever a clip has cuts or speed spans.

**How the user works.** One clip at a time with `--cards none`, getting the
timing right before moving on; then every three or four clips together, with
cards, to check flow and adjust titles. So single-clip previews are the hot
path and must stay fast — a preview only edits the clips it will actually
show, and previews carry no media title, because VLC paints that tag over the
picture on every seek and it lands on top of the annotations.

**The sheet is validated before every build**, and errors stop it before
ffmpeg runs; `--no-check` overrides. `--cards none|leading|all` controls which
cards a `--clip` preview includes — `none` makes preview times equal the
clip's own times, which is what you want while timing text; `all` matches the
finished video.

Four supporting scripts, none of which touch the video: `check_sheet.py`
(the same validation, standalone — syntax, unknown keys, annotations past the
end of their clip, overlaps), `check_environment.sh` (verify a machine can build —
run it before committing hours to a normalize pass), `restore_raw_clips.sh`
(fetch and SHA-256 verify the footage), `make_manifest.sh` (regenerate
`raw_clips.tsv`).

`normalize_and_join.sh` already ran. Do not run it again unless the source
clips change.

**`--help` is authoritative for the sheet format** — it prints the module
docstring, which documents every key. Read it before changing the parser.

---

## 4. The edit sheet — `annotations.yaml`

**`python3 build.py --help` is authoritative** — it prints the module
docstring, which documents every key. Read it before changing the parser.
`python3 check_sheet.py` validates a sheet without building anything.

A list of clip blocks, in order. The clip number **is** the block, so it
cannot go missing.

```yaml
- clip: 1
  chapter: Greeting of the Hierarch at the Doors
  cards:        # played BEFORE this clip; `after: true` puts one after
  annotations:  # on-screen text and speed/cut spans, in time order
  notes:        # published — for the written document
  todos:        # the user's own; never on screen, never printed
  skip: true    # leave this clip out
  join: true    # continue the previous clip: no chapter, no fade between
```

Singular and plural are synonyms throughout: `annotation`/`annotations`,
`card`/`cards`, `cut`/`cuts`, `note`/`notes`, `todo`/`todos`.

**Timing.** Write times bare — `1:27`, `1:03:23`, `0:04`, `87`, `4.5`. On an
annotation `at:` (or `from:`) is the start and may be **left out**, in which
case it picks up 0.2s after the previous annotation ends, or at 0 if it is
the first in the clip. `for:` is a duration — leave it out and the annotation holds until the next
one starts, falling back to 4s when there is no next or its start is itself
relative. `to:` is an absolute
end, and **`to: end` runs to the end of the clip** — on spans too, so a cut
`from: 60, to: end` trims the tail. `at: next+1.5` waits longer. Resolves in
sheet order.

**Fades are deliberately asymmetric.** `--cut-fade` eases the sound down
*into* a cut but there is no fade in on the way out, because the user picks
cut end points at moments of silence — solving it in the edit rather than in
the encoder. Do not add a fade in unasked.

**Spans.** `speed:` and `cut: true` entries sit inline in the annotations
list so a clip reads in time order. Both ends must be given, and a span never
advances where the next annotation picks up. `speed: 4x` sets a rate;
`speed: true` defers to `--speed`. `audio:` is `mute` (default), `fast`
(time-stretched to fit, pitch intact but hurried) or `normal` (natural speed;
the opening of the span plays untouched for as long as the sped video lasts —
right for background singing — it holds full volume for `hold:` seconds,
default 4, then fades to silence rather than stopping dead). `mute:
true/false` is the older spelling of `mute`/`fast`.

**Cards** belong to the clip they are written under and play before it;
`after: true` puts one after. A skipped clip takes only its own cards with it.

**Chapters.** `chapter:` always means "a chapter starts here, titled this".
On a card it makes the card its own chapter, with a title that need not match
the words on screen; a card without `chapter:` folds into the chapter that
follows.

**Text.** Put prose under `text: >` or `text: |` — no quoting or escaping
ever. Blank lines are kept and render as a gap. `**bold**`, `*italic*` and
`_underline_` work anywhere; `#`, `##`, `###` set heading sizes on cards.
Cards render through libass, not drawtext, which is what makes more than one
size per card possible. Chapter names strip the markers. **Never put prose inside `{ }`**: a comma there ends the value and
silently swallows the rest of the sentence.

**A key cannot repeat in one block.** Writing `annotations:` twice parses
without error and discards the first list.
## 5. Everything is written against the ORIGINAL clip

Annotation times, cut times and speed times are all measured on the untouched
footage. The script maps them through the edits. So in a 3:00 clip:

```yaml
- clip: 7
  annotations:
    - from: 1:00
      to: 2:00
      cut: true
    - at: 2:30
      for: 4
      role: D1
      text: …
    - from: 2:45
      to: 2:55
      cut: true
```

the annotation lands at 1:30 and the second cut at 1:45. **Nothing is ever
re-timed by hand.** Adding cards, changing card durations, skipping clips, or
resizing an edit shifts nothing in the sheet.

The one exception: **trimming the head of a clip** shifts that clip's own
offsets. Tail trims are harmless. Nothing outside the clip is affected.

> A user asked why an annotation typed as `46` appeared at `0:54` — because an
> 8-second title card sits ahead of clip 1. Correct behaviour, not a bug.
> **Do not "fix" this.**

---

## 6. Deacon roles

Two deacons, treated as the normal case.

> **D1 (protodeacon) takes everything touching the hierarch directly** — the
> dialogues, censing of the bishop, the Gospel, the great commemoration, the
> diskos. **Litanies alternate beginning with D2.**

Clip 24 confirms D2 is last in the shoulder-kissing. (An earlier
`hierarchical_liturgy_cue_sheet.md` held a fuller table, but it was written
before the 37 clips were in hand and the user has confirmed it is no longer
needed — the footage supersedes it. Do not go looking for it.)

**The vocabulary is deliberately unsettled** — the user is working out which
roles are worth highlighting. Seen so far: `D1`, `D2`, `AS1+2`, `AS3+4`,
`DEACONS`, `PRIEST`, `CHOIR`. Any code gets a colour automatically.
**Do not push to freeze this.** Two open questions, not resolved: whether
`DEACONS` should be `D1+D2` for consistency, and whether long codes should
render smaller, since the role is a bold prefix that eats width.

**⚠ The user has a diocesan roles chart** for one, two, three and four
deacons. **Still not uploaded.** It resolves every `[verify]` and is the one
outstanding item that could change annotation *text* rather than timings.

---

## 7. Environment and traps

- macOS, zsh, Apple Silicon. ffmpeg 9.0.1 from the **`homebrew-ffmpeg/ffmpeg`
  tap** — the default brew formula lacked `drawtext` and `libass`.
- **The sheet is edited in VS Code, not a spreadsheet.** The CSV era ended
  because Numbers blanked the `clip` column on export — twice — silently
  dropping most annotations and then most chapter rows. In YAML the clip
  number is the block, so that class of failure is gone. Do not reintroduce
  a spreadsheet.
- **IINA bug:** opening the playlist/chapter panel and jumping chapters kills
  the subtitle track, and you cannot return to 0:00 without restarting. Use
  VLC, or `ffplay -ss N -vf "ass=annotations.ass" master.mp4`.
- **VLC needs the subtitle track switched on** (press `v`), even when flagged
  default.
- **YouTube silently drops ALL chapters** if any is under 10s, if the first is
  not 00:00, or if there are fewer than three. `build.py` warns.
- **Sparse annotations look like a bug.** Three times the user thought
  generation had failed when the cause was a long gap between timed
  annotations, or a preview containing only one chapter. **Check the actual
  event times before debugging anything.**

---

## 8. ✅ Resolved: chapter titles

Symptom: `liturgy_training.mkv` had 38 chapters with correct start times and
**no titles at all**.

Cause: `-map_metadata` copies *global* metadata; chapter titles are
per-chapter and need **`-map_chapters`**. The mux was missing it.

Fix applied to `build.py` and **now confirmed on the real footage** — a
`build.py --clip 3` preview mux produced `TAG:title=Entrance Prayers`, with
the subtitle track present and flagged default. Nothing further to do.

To re-check after any change to the mux:

```bash
python3 build.py --clip 3
ffprobe -v error -show_chapters output/preview.mkv | grep -i title
```

---

## 9. Coverage gaps

- **~18m after clip 20** — the homily. Deliberate. Card planned.
- **~27m after clip 33** — Lord's Prayer, elevation, fraction, communion of
  clergy and faithful. Neither notes nor footage cover it.

**The user has watched all the footage and asked not to keep raising these.
Respect that.**

---

## 10. Editorial cleanup, outstanding

**A full consistency pass is deferred until the first annotation draft is
finished** — the user's explicit instruction, so that wording is not polished
twice. This section is the running list; the user adds to it as things occur
to them. Do not start it early, and do not let it distract from the draft.

### Roles — get the vocabulary right first

The `role:` values are inconsistent already. Counted across the sheet on
24 Aug 2026:

    27  FIRST DEACON        6  ALTAR SERVERS       2  PRIEST
    26  SERVERS             5  SUBDEACONS          2  ALTAR SERVER
    18  SECOND DEACON       1  SUBDEACON           1  CHOIR
    13  DEACONS

Three spellings of the server role and two of subdeacon. Before normalising
the strings, settle the **substance**: is `SERVERS` the same office as
`ALTAR SERVERS`, and where does `SUBDEACONS` genuinely differ? A subdeacon is
tonsured and a server is not, and they do different things at a hierarchical
liturgy — so this is a question about accuracy, not tidiness, and the user's
priest and the footage decide it.

Only once that is settled: pick one spelling per office, singular or plural
consistently, and apply it everywhere.

### Content still to place

Things the user wants said somewhere, not yet written into the sheet.

- **When are the final bishop's prayers read?** The user does not know and
  intends to find out. Raised while looking at clip 3, where the first deacon
  *"reads the entrance prayers quietly, as normal, BUT stops before 'I will
  enter thy house'"* — so what happens to the remainder is an open thread.
  Clip 7 is titled *Final Prayers before the Liturgy*, which may or may not be
  the same moment; do not assume it is.

- **Deacons kiss the Holy Table before touching it.** Wanted in the
  introduction. Widely forgotten in parish practice, and a bishop will insist
  on it — which is the point worth making, and the reason it belongs early
  rather than buried at the moment it first applies.

### Left/right vs north/south — a real ambiguity, not just wording

Ten clips mention the dikiri and trikiri (6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 26, 27),
and they use **two different frames of reference**:

- clip 6: *"Dikiri on bishops **left** … trikiri on the **right**"* — the
  bishop's own body
- clip 15: *"Dikiri on the **right**, Trikiri on the **left**"* — the viewer's,
  as stated by the sentence that follows it

Both are correct, and both agree with the confirmed local practice. But read
one after the other they say the opposite, and the reader has to notice the
frame changed. **North and south are unambiguous whoever is facing where**,
which is why the diagram uses them. Prefer them in annotation text, or say
whose left is meant every single time.

### Then, wording

- Terms, case, spelling, grammar and punctuation across every annotation,
  card, chapter and note — one pass, at the end.
- Source notes skip section 11 and use 20 twice.
- Transliterations vary: *Ton Des Postin / Ton Despotin*; *Eis Polla Eti Thes
  Posta* (= *Eis polla eti, despota*); *Kolbuk / Klobuk*; *Matiya / Mantiya*;
  *Trikiri / Trikirion*. "**Jezel**" is Slavonic *zhezl*, the same staff called
  "Staff" elsewhere. Normalize; consider a glossary card.
- **Check the hierarchs' names** in the long commemoration before publishing.
- Clip 02 is titled "Bishop moves to the cathedra" but precedes the entrance
  prayers, while the notes put the cathedra after. Confirm against the footage.

### Dikirion and trikirion — which side, and the crossing

Researched 24 Aug 2026. The rule is sourced; the choreography is not.

**Sourced.** OrthodoxWiki: *"The trikirion is always on the bishop's right,
and the dikirion on his left"*, and they are kept *"respectively on the
northeast and southeast corners of the altar"* — dikirion northeast, trikirion
southeast. Those two agree, since a bishop at the Holy Table facing east has
his right hand to the south.

**Follows necessarily.** Facing **east**, trikirion is south and dikirion
north. Facing **west** toward the people, they reverse. So the bearers must
cross when he turns — the only way to keep the trikirion in his right hand
through a 180° turn. Not a local custom.

**Local practice, confirmed by the user:** at the Great Entrance the
**trikirion stands north and the dikirion south** — already set for the bishop
to bless the congregation, since facing west his right hand is to the north.
The Great Entrance diagram shows this arrangement, with the swap noted.

**Open, and not answerable from sources:** exactly *when* in the Great
Entrance they cross — before setting out, on the solea, or as he turns. The
user is confident the crossing always happens and cannot see it himself from
behind the Holy Table; he is asking **an experienced subdeacon in the
diocese**. That person is also the obvious route to the roles chart of §6,
still outstanding.

Worth showing in the Great Entrance diagram once confirmed, as arrows for Di
and Tr exchanging sides — it is precisely what the footage cannot show and
what the written sources are vaguest about.

---

## 11. Notes for whoever picks this up

- **Claude cannot watch video** — only metadata and extracted stills. Never ask
  for the clips.
- **This is OCA / Russian recension.** Do not drift toward Greek or Antiochian
  usage.
- The user's priest and the footage are authoritative. Where this project
  infers, it says so. Keep that discipline.
- When something is broken, give commands **one at a time** and wait for
  output. Long multi-step blocks caused confusion more than once.
- Don't guess at causes. Twice tonight a confident diagnosis was wrong and the
  real cause only appeared after running the user's actual file. **Reproduce
  before explaining.**
- **State the plan before executing it.** The user asked for this explicitly.
  Say what you intend to do and wait for a go, especially for anything slow,
  outward-facing, or hard to undo. Read-only inspection to inform the plan is
  fine and expected.
- **Verify, don't assume.** Every claim in this file that says DONE was
  actually run. Follow that: prove the round trip, diff the output, check the
  real file.
- The user works on a **Mac laptop** (Apple Silicon, macOS). Cross-machine
  continuity means another Mac or a fresh clone after a disk failure — see §12.

## Files

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `build.py` | the entire toolchain |
| `annotations.yaml` | the edit sheet |
| `raw_clips.tsv` | manifest: size, SHA-256, duration, codec of all 37 clips |
| `normalize_and_join.sh` | raw → normalized → master; already run, don't re-run |
| `restore_raw_clips.sh` | download the footage from the release and verify it |
| `check_environment.sh` | verify a machine can build before committing hours |
| `check_sheet.py` | validate the edit sheet without building |
| `make_document.py` | build the written rubric — markdown and HTML |
| `make_manifest.sh` | regenerate `raw_clips.tsv` |
| `README.md` | recovery runbook: bare Mac → finished video |
| `CLAUDE.md` | this file |

Three files this document used to list —
`hierarchical_liturgy_cue_sheet.md`, `clip_to_chapter_map.md`, and
`notes_for_hierarchical_divine_liturgy.pdf` — **no longer exist and are not
needed.** They were scaffolding from before the 37 clips were in hand. The
user has confirmed the footage supersedes them. Don't hunt for them, and
don't ask the user to re-supply them.

---

## 12. The repository and disaster recovery

**github.com/catmando/hierarchical-liturgy-deacon-training** — public, owned
by `catmando` (not the `catprintlabs` org, to keep it off company billing).

### Layout

Directories are named for the order the pipeline runs them. Nothing tracked
by git lives in a subdirectory, so ffmpeg can write freely without ever
showing up in `git status`.

```
build.py, *.py, *.sh, annotations.yaml, raw_clips.tsv, README.md, CLAUDE.md
raw/          37 source clips · 6.8 GB   — not in git; on the release
normalized/   build.py working files     — not in git; rebuildable
output/       master, mkv, subs, chapters — not in git; rebuildable
junk/         parked, deliberately not deleted
```

`junk/` exists because the user asked that nothing be deleted. Park things
there rather than removing them. It currently holds `test.mkv` and
`check.mkv`, 7.1 GB each.

### Why the footage isn't in git

6.8 GB, with 27 clips over GitHub's 100 MB per-file hard limit. Git LFS was
rejected deliberately: **LFS bandwidth is billed to the repo owner and
downloads by strangers count**, which on a public repo is an uncapped bill.
Release assets have no bandwidth metering and a 2 GB per-file ceiling, which
every clip clears comfortably.

### Recovery

Full runbook in `README.md`. The short version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catmando/hierarchical-liturgy-deacon-training.git
cd hierarchical-liturgy-deacon-training
./check_environment.sh          # tools, ffmpeg filters, font, disk, auth
./restore_raw_clips.sh          # 6.8 GB into raw/, SHA-256 verified
./normalize_and_join.sh         # hours; overnight; resumable
python3 build.py
```

**This path is tested, not theoretical.** Clip 01 was moved aside, recovered
from the release, and confirmed byte-identical; `make_manifest.sh` was
confirmed to reproduce the committed manifest exactly.

### Two traps worth knowing

- **GitHub rewrites release asset names**, turning spaces into dots:
  `01 - Greeting….mp4` is stored as `01.-.Greeting….mp4`.
  `restore_raw_clips.sh` maps them back via the manifest. Verified against
  the live API, not assumed.
- **ffmpeg must come from the `homebrew-ffmpeg/ffmpeg` tap.** The stock
  formula has shipped without `drawtext` and `libass`, which the title cards
  and the annotation overlay respectively depend on. `check_environment.sh`
  probes for exactly these.

### The source clips are not uniformly 30 fps

25 are 30 fps, six are 179/6 (≈29.83), five are 119/4 (≈29.75), and one is
120 fps. All 1920×1080 h264/aac, 63.4 minutes total. This is precisely why
`normalize_and_join.sh` exists — concatenating them raw produces broken
timing.

---

## 13. Plan diagrams — `art/`

Top-down plans of the church showing who stands where. They teach placement
better than the footage does, because a camera cannot show the whole floor at
once, and they carry no copyright encumbrance.

SVG is the source; the PNG the video uses is regenerated from it:

```bash
rsvg-convert -w 1920 -h 1080 art/great_entrance_plan.svg \
             -o art/great_entrance_plan.png
```

Used through an `image:` card, which is verified to work end to end:

```yaml
- clip: 26
  cards:
    - image: art/great_entrance_plan.png
      for: 10
      chapter: The Great Entrance — positions
```

Give a diagram ~10s, not the 6 a title card gets — it has to be studied.

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `church_plan.svg` | bare architecture, the starting point for new diagrams |
| `great_entrance_plan.svg` | the procession once outside the altar |

**The Great Entrance plan is confirmed correct by the user**, including the
inferred architecture. Convention: east at the top, so north is left and
south is right. Marker colours follow the on-screen role colours.

Worth drawing next, all reusing `church_plan.svg`: the vesting, the little
entrance, censing paths, and the order of shoulder-kissing.

### Wanted, once the first draft is done: diagrams beside the video

The user wants a diagram shown *alongside* the footage rather than as a card
that interrupts it — pictorial annotation. Deliberately deferred until the
annotation pass is finished; do not start it early.

The mechanism already exists in the codebase. `burn_timecode()` overlays a
drawtext per segment switched on with `enable='between(t,S,E)'`; a diagram is
the same shape with `overlay` instead, and the annotation timing model
supplies the spans for free. Sketch:

```yaml
    - at: 1:20
      for: 20
      image: art/great_entrance_plan.png    # beside the picture, not a card
      text: Positions once outside the altar
```

Two things to decide when it is built. Whether the video shrinks to make room
(a real layout change, and every annotation position would move) or the
diagram floats over a corner (cheap, but covers footage). And that it means
re-encoding, like `--timecode` — so it belongs in the burn step rather than
in `master.mp4`, or previews get slow again.

---

## 14. Published

**Video:** https://youtu.be/aRs9oqKMCd8 — unlisted, 59:34, 35 chapters,
annotations burned in. Built 25 August 2026 from `build.py --youtube`.
An earlier cut at `o8MRc9T90hY` is superseded: it lacks the greeting plan
card, so every chapter after the first sits 10s earlier.

**Written rubric:** `make_document.py` builds it from the same sheet, so it
cannot drift from the video. Regenerate whenever either changes:

```bash
python3 make_document.py --video https://youtu.be/aRs9oqKMCd8
```

Chapter headings then link into the video at the right second. Always
regenerate *after* a rebuild — the timings come from `output/chapters.txt`,
so a stale document sends readers to the wrong moment.

---

## 15. Distribution — thought about, not decided

Raised 21 August 2026 while the user was at clip 9 of 37. Nothing is built;
this records the analysis so it does not have to be redone.

### Size

`master.mp4` is **6.5 GB at 15.3 Mbps** — archival, more than handing out
needs. Measured from a 30s sample scaled to the full 63 minutes:

| target | full video |
|---|---|
| current, CRF 18 | 6.5 GB |
| 1080p CRF 24 | 4.0 GB |
| **1080p CRF 26** | **3.0 GB** |
| 1080p CRF 28 | 2.2 GB |
| 720p CRF 23 | 2.2 GB |

**Stay at 1080p.** At equal file size, 720p makes the annotation text mushy —
text suffers from downscaling far more than the footage does.

### Three traps for a thumb drive

- **Format the drive exFAT, not FAT32.** FAT32 caps a single file at 4 GB, and
  a larger copy fails part way through, sometimes without a clear error. Most
  drives ship FAT32. This is the likeliest way a handout day goes wrong.
- **Do not hand out the MKV.** Its annotations are a subtitle *track*:
  QuickTime will not open MKV at all, Windows needs VLC, and VLC still needs
  `v`. Distribute mp4 with the text **burned in** — it plays everywhere and
  needs no instructions.
- **A burned-in mp4 has no chapter menu.** Put `chapters.txt` on the drive as
  a plain listing.

### Online

**YouTube unlisted** is stronger than a drive for most people: free, plays on
any phone or TV, nothing to lose, and chapters work — `youtube_chapters.txt`
is already generated. Unlisted is not searchable; only a link reaches it.
Caveat the user should weigh deliberately rather than inherit from the GitHub
decision: the footage shows identifiable clergy and parishioners, and YouTube
is a different reach from a public repo.

A GitHub release asset is the other free option, but assets cap at 2 GB per
file, which a 3 GB video clears only if the quality drops further.

### Still to build

- **`--distribute`**: burned-in text, 1080p CRF 26, `+faststart`, chapters
  beside it. `--youtube` exists but burns at CRF 18 / preset slow and would
  produce roughly 9 GB, which is wrong for this.
- **The written document.** `notes:` fields are collected for it and nothing
  generates one yet — the user chose "carry the field only" when the format
  was designed. It is what would make a thumb drive a package rather than a
  video file.
